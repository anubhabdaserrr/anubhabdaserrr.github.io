I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in `Computer Science` in July 2022 & my interests primarily lie in 1. Building meaningful products that's useful in our everyday lives; & 2. Using a data-driven approach to understand the world at large; specifically, online discussions & communities.

Currently, I'm working as a `Software Development Engineer (SDE-1)` at `Textify AI`. I've also served as a `Visiting Researcher` on a project to analyze the contents of subreddits & study health discussions on social media, using NLP & text analysis tools with research scientists at `Nokia Bell Labs, Cambridge`.

I'm actively looking for Software Engineering or Data Science roles.
Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn. :) Find my resume here: [Link](https://bit.ly/adasdevresume).
