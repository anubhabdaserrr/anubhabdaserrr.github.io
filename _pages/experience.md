##### Project 1: Comparative Analysis of Generative Adversarial Networks for Bangla Character Generation
September 2020 - April 2021\
Tech Stack: *Python, NumPy, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib*

<!-- Worked under the guidance of Prof. N. Das, Dept. of Computer Science -->

- Trained 3 GANs : DCGAN, ACGAN & WGAN-GP for Bangla character generation
- Dataset used : BanglaLekha-Isolated (84 bangla characters : Numerals, basic & compound characters)
- Performance comparison using Inception Score (IS) & Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). Fine-tuned Inception Model prior to evaluation for better evaluation.
- Preliminary attempts have been made to explore the latent space using vector arithmetic to generate unseen compound characters. Some samples for the same, can be seen in the following figure.
